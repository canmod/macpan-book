# Fast and Flexible Modelling with McMasterPandemic

[McMasterPandemic](https://github.com/mac-theobio/McMasterPandemic) is a modelling tool that was rapidly developed to provide timely insights into the Covid-19 Pandemic in Canada. We are currently refactoring this tool so that it is faster and more general. This guide describes how to use this refactored version of McMasterPandemic.

## Installation

This generalized McMasterPandemic framework is still in an experimental phase. Therefore you will need to install the `tmb-condense` code branch that contains the experimental implementation directly from github. A convenient way to do this is to use the `remotes` package as follows.

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mac-theobio/McMasterPandemic@tmb-condense")
```

## Dependencies

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(McMasterPandemic))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lubridate))
```

This guide makes use of the following session.
```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```

## Generalized Model at a Glance

The general model underlying McMasterPandmic's flexible engine and interface based on a discrete time compartmental model.

$$
s_{i,t+1} = s_{i,t} + \underbrace{\sum_j M_{ji,t} s_{j,t}}_{\text{inflow}} - \underbrace{s_{i,t} \sum_j  M_{ij,t} {\mathcal I}_{ij}}_{\text{outflow}}
$$
where,

* $s_{i,t}$ is the state of the $i$th compartment at time $t$
* $M_{ij,t}$ is the per-capita rate of flow from compartment $i$ to compartment $j$ at time $t$
* ${\mathcal I}_{ij}\in\{0,1\}$ indicates whether or not individuals should be removed from compartment $i$ after flowing to compartment $j$

The per-capita rates, $M_{ij,t}$, can be any expression involving only sums and products of any of the following at time $t$:

  * State of any compartment
  * Model parameter -- either time-varying or not
  * Complements of any of the above (i.e. $1-x$)
  * Inverses of any of the above (i.e. $1/x$)
