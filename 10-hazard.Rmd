# Hazard Smoothing

[The Euler-multinomial](https://rdrr.io/rforge/pomp/man/eulermultinom.html) distribution is a good place to get a little background on the hazard smoothing approach.

$$
p_j = \left(1-\exp\left(-\sum_i{r_i dt}\right)\right) \frac{r_j}{\sum_i r_i}.
$$
The first piece is the probability of leaving the box at an exponential rate, and the second piece is that fraction of flows going to a particular box.

Define the sums of the rows of the rate matrix. 
$$
r_i = \sum_{j=1}^n M_{ij}
$$ 
Define the elements of a vector of exponentiated row sums 
$$
\rho_i = \exp(-r_i)
$$

Define the elements of a normalized state vector.
$$
\tilde{s}_i = \begin{cases}
0 & r_i = 0 \\
\frac{s_i}{r_i} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ 
With these definitions we can define the modified flow matrix. 
$$
F_{ij} = \begin{cases}
M_{ij}\tilde{s}_i(1-\rho_i) & i \ne j \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ 
This modified flow matrix can now be used in the same way as the unmodified flow matrix to produce state variable updates following spec version 0.0.2.
